title: What is Effect
---

Pretty much everything interesting that a computer can do is interacting with the outside world.
<br />
Interacting with the outside world is unpredictable, we call programs that interact with the outside world effectful.
<br />
Effect is a library that gives predictability to such programs by empowering you with a set of composable building blocks to model the patterns that you'll need on a daily basis.
<br />

## Recognising Side Effects

When writing programs in `TypeScript` we are used to code that looks like:

```ts twoslash
const greet = (name: string) => {
  const greeting = `hello ${name}`
  console.log(greeting)
  return greeting
}
```

When such function is invoked like `greet("Michael")` the message `hello Michael` is printed out in the console.
<br />
Whenever any state external to the function scope is mutated (in this case the console state) a function is said to contain side effects.
<br />
Another way of looking at the same issue is through the lenses of referential transparency, a pure function (a function that doesn't contain side effects) has the property of respecting evaluation substitution, that means if I have something like `f(g(x), g(x))` it is safe to refactor to `const y = g(x); f(y, y);` functions with side effects violate this property, for example the following two programs yield different outputs:

```ts twoslash
const greet = (name: string) => {
  const greeting = `hello ${name}`
  console.log(greeting)
  return greeting
}
// ---cut---
const program1 = () => {
  console.log(`length: ${greet('Michael') + greet('Michael')}`)
}

const program2 = () => {
  const x = greet('Michael')
  console.log(`length: ${x + x}`)
}
```

Namely `program1` will print twice the message `hello Michael` and `program2` will print only once.
<br />

Code that contains side effects is hard to maintain, it can't be safely refactored and it's fundamentally hard to write in a safe and fast manner.
<br />

## Programming with Effect

Turning side effects into effects allows you to deal with such programs in a fully safe manner, let's start by writing the same program with `Effect`.

```ts twoslash
import * as E from '@effect/core/io/Effect'
import { pipe } from '@tsplus/stdlib/data/Function'

const greet = (name: string) =>
  pipe(
    E.succeed(`hello ${name}`),
    E.tap((greeting) => E.logInfo(greeting)),
  )

const program1 = pipe(
  greet('Michael'),
  E.zipWith(greet('Michael'), (x, y) => x + y),
  E.tap((message) => E.logInfo(`length: ${message}`)),
)

const greetMichael = greet('Michael')

const program2 = pipe(
  greetMichael,
  E.zipWith(greetMichael, (x, y) => x + y),
  E.flatMap((message) => E.logInfo(`length: ${message}`)),
)
```

When executed the result of `program1` and the one of `program2` will be exactly the same, namely twice the message `hello Michael` will be printed out in the console followed by a message containing the length of the concatenated strings.
<br />

## Executing Effects

`Effect` can execute programs in various ways, the simplest one is the execution to a `Promise<Value>` that may be used for interop purposes.

```ts twoslash
import * as E from '@effect/core/io/Effect'
import { pipe } from '@tsplus/stdlib/data/Function'

const program = pipe(E.logInfo('Hello'), E.zipRight(E.logInfo('World')))

E.unsafeRunPromise(program)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Execution Completed')
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log('Execution Failed')
  })
```

<br />

## The Effect Type

The `Effect` type contains 3 type parameters, the full type looks like `Effect<Services, Errors, Success>` and they respectively indicate:

<br />
- `Services`: the list of requirements that your program needs
- `Errors`: the list of errors that your program may encounter
- `Success`: the value that your program returns

<br />

As we will see in the next chapters those type parameters are leveraged by `Effect` to provide the best possible developer experience when dealing with dependency injection and error handling for your everyday usage.
